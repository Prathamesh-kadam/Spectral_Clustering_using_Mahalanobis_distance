Spectral Clustering with Mahalanobis Distance for Aerosol Classification
This project implements Weighted Mahalanobis Distance Spectral Clustering (MDLSC) for aerosol classification using spectral data. The method improves clustering accuracy and ensures consistency across different feature pairs.

Features
Mahalanobis Distance-based clustering for improved classification.

Consistent cluster mapping across feature pairs.

Automated CSV generation with centroid values and percentages.

Visualization of clustered data with labeled centroids.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Run the script in Google Colab to process and visualize clustering results.

Modify dataset paths as needed for different analyses.

Results
Clusters classified into Dust, Biomass Burning, Urban, and Mixed Aerosols.

Ensures fixed colors, centroid values, and cluster order for consistent interpretation.
